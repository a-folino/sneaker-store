# SneakerLand
A front end for a sneaker store I built with TypeScript, React with Redux Toolkit, SASS. I couldn't find a good free sneakers API so I am fetching the data from a local data file that I put together to mimic a database.

### clone repo

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
