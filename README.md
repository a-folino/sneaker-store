# SneakerLand
A front end for a sneaker store I built with TypeScript, React with Redux Toolkit, SASS. I couldn't find a good free sneakers API so I am fetching the data from a local data file that I put together to mimic a database.


It has a cart, filter functionality for sorting sneakers and is fully responsive across devices.

### `clone repo`

then

### `npm install`

then

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
